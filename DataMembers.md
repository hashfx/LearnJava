These are the variables whose memory space is created each and every time whenever we create an object | These are the variables whose memory space is created only once whenever the class is loaded in the main memory|
Instance data members are used to store specific value| static data members are used to store common values|
Each and every instance data member must be accessed with respect to object name|Each and every data member must be accessed with respect to class name|
