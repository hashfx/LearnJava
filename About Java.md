# About JAVA☕

+ ### **Father:** James Arthur Gosling aka Dr. Java (1955)

+ ### **Principle:** Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multi-threaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic

+ ### **Etymology:** Java is an island of Indonesia where first coffee was produced(Java Coffee)

+ ### **Paradigm:** Generic, Object-oriented, Imperative, Reflective

# Java character set

Java uses **Unicode** character set.  </br>
**65,536** characters are available in Java </br>
For Example:

+ A: 65 (ASCII for A)
+ B: 66 (ASCII for B)
+ A(devanagari): 400  (ASCII)
+ Aa(devanagari): 401 (ASCII)

# History of Java

+ Java is one of the programming language created for development of distributed applications
+ Java software is developed at SunMicro Systems by James Arthur Gosling
+ Java development was started in the year 1990 and completed in the middle of 1991
+ Guardians of Java
  + SunMicro System has handed over entire rights of Java to Oracle

### NOTE

+ Java software is available in the form of JDK (Java Development Kit)

+ In the real industry, Java software is present in 3 categories
  + **J2SE (Java to Standard Edition)**
    +      used for developing client side applications
  + **J2EE (Java to Enterprise Edition)**
    +      used for developing server side applications
  + **J2ME (Java to Micro Edition)**
    +      used for developing mobile applications

# Features of Java

### **Simple**

+ Java is simple language and the basic reason behind this is that Java has removed the concept of pointers
+ Pointers lead to confuse program
+ Pointer may crash program easily
+ Pointers may break security

### **Object Oriented**

Java is object oriented which supports features of object oriented language:

+ Features of OOPS
  + class
  + object
  + encapsulation
  + abstraction
  + inheritance
  + polymorphism

### **Robust**

+ Robust means strong; Java programs do not crash easily
+ There are two reasons behind it:
+ Java has powerful concept called **Exception handling _(run time problems)_**
+ Java has in-built memory feature
+ Most of the C/C++ programs crash in the middle because they are not able to allocate sufficient memory or forget to free the allocated memory.
+ Such problems are not present in Java because here user need not to allocate/reallocate the memory. Every care would be taken by **JVM(Java Virtual Machine**)

### **Architecture Neutral**

+ Java is **Architecture Neutral Language** because the size of data type is same across the platform

### **Portable**

+ Portable applications are those which can run on each and every Operating System; and each and every processor without considering their vendor.

### **Platform Independent**

+ Java is a Platform Independent Language
+ `.java` is converted to `.class` file after being compiled.
+ This `.class` file is then converted to native code of OS
+ **Note**: JVM is Platform Dependent

### **Multi-Threaded**

+ Thread is a light-weight process.
+ The basic aim of multi-threading is **to achieve concurrent execution**
+ **The flow of control in Java is known as Thread**
+ The purpose of thread is to execute the program

### **Secure**

+ Java program has pre-defined API for security
